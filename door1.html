            <li>Long, long ago, 2 Students, A and B decided to have a dive-off at the Mackenzie invisible pool. Student A jumps off an invisible beanstalk at 396.9 meters at t = 0. Then Student B jumps off an invisible beanstalk at 333.5 meters at t = 1.25 sec. Student A lands in the water 9 seconds after t = 0. Student B lands 9.5 seconds after t = 0.</li>

            <li>During Halloween, the Gardening Club wants to open up a pop-up tent to sell their spooky cookies. Unfortunately, the tent material is translucent, and so they must put multiple sheets to cover most of the sun. Without a cover, the brightness of the sun is 100%. The brightness of the sun decreases by 15% for each sheet layer.</li>
            <ul>
                a) If the Gardening Club has a budget of $20 dollars for the tent material and the total cost of n sheets of material is found using this equation:
                <br><br><img src="images/image444.png" alt="square"><br><br>
                Find the number of sheets that the Gardening Club is able to afford.
                <br>
                <br>
                b) Find the percent brightness of the sun after the sheets found in a) are put on the tent.
