            <li>Alisa starts at age 16, investing $50/month into her parentâ€™s GIC, earning 3.8%/year, compounding monthly for 2 years. She then transfers the money into her own account, earning 2.2%/year, compounding monthly. To pay for her consumer needs, she withdraws $25/month until there's no money left.</li>
            <ul>
                How old is she when there is no money left in her bank account?
            </ul>
            <li>Alisa notices that her investment in options seems to follow a very particular pattern. She records out her balance each week for a total of 8 weeks: 21, -26, 82, -242, 730, -2186, 6562, -19682.</li>
            <ul>
                If Alisa wants to withdraw at about 100k, at what week would she withdraw at?
            </ul>
        </ol>
