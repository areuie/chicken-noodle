            <li>Alisa is facing East, and JC is facing 35° north of east at the same spot before they both start to drive away. JC drives for 30 minutes at a speed of 44 km/h in the direction he is facing and then turns right by a certain angle, then drives 15 min at a speed of 64 km/h to meet Alisa. </li>
            <ul>
                a) How far has Alisa driven?
                <br> 
                Note: The formula for speed is: s = d/t
            </ul>
            <li>A student’s eyes during a class sinusoidally opens and slightly close as they doze off during class. At a minimum, the student’s eyes are 10% open and at a maximum, the student’s eyes are 80%. It takes 16 seconds to go from the minimum to the maximum. At 0 seconds, the eye starts out 10% open.</li>
            <ul>
                Write a cosine function in degrees (w/o units) modelling the percent “openness” of the student’s eye vs the time in seconds. Make sure to convert the percent into decimal when making the function (i.e 55% →0.55).
